# How to read and view documentation?

## What is it for?

Project documentation, typically written in Markdown (.md) files, provides clear instructions and explanations for developers. It helps us:

- Understand the project structure and architecture
- Learn how the code works
- Set up, use, and maintain the system effectively

To properly read a documentation press `ctrl + shift + v` on VSCode which give you a better visual ground to read this
file/documents

## How to View Markdown Files?

Markdown files are plain text, but you can view them in a **formatted, easy-to-read way:**

- In VS Code: Press `Ctrl + Shift + V (or Cmd + Shift + V on Mac)` to open the Markdown preview.
- In GitHub/GitLab: Open the .md file in the repository to see it rendered with headers, lists, tables, and code blocks.
- Using other tools: Apps like Typora, Mark Text, or Obsidian can render Markdown beautifully.

## Tips for Reading Documentation

1. **Start with the Overview/README:** Understand the project purpose and structure.
2. **Follow the Sections:** Use headers (`#, ##, ###`) to navigate modules, services, or APIs.
3. **Check Examples and Code Blocks:** They show how the code is used.
4. **Look for Notes or Warnings:** Pay attention to operational tips or known issues
