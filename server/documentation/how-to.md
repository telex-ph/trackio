# How to read and view documentation?

## What is it for?

Project documentation, typically written in Markdown (.md) files, provides clear instructions and explanations for developers. It helps us:

- Understand the project structure and architecture
- Learn how the code works
- Set up, use, and maintain the system effectively

## How to View Markdown Files?

You might wonder how the hell am I suppose to read this? There's so much going on! Is the author of this documentation dumb? Say no more my dear friendo, just read the following bullets to light up the bulb above your head.

Markdown files are plain text, but you can view them in a **formatted, easy-to-read way**:

- In VS Code: Press `Ctrl + Shift + V (or Cmd + Shift + V on Mac)` to open the Markdown preview. (**Recommended**)
- In GitHub/GitLab: Open the .md file in the repository to see it rendered with headers, lists, tables, and code blocks.
- Using other tools: Apps like Typora, Mark Text, or Obsidian can render Markdown beautifully.

voilà!!!💡

## Tips for Reading Documentation

1. **Start with the Overview/README:** Understand the project purpose and structure.
2. **Follow the Sections:** Use headers (`#, ##, ###`) to navigate modules, services, or APIs.
3. **Check Examples and Code Blocks:** They show how the code is used.
4. **Look for Notes or Warnings:** Pay attention to operational tips or known issues
